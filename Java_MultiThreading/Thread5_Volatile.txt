# 🔹 What is `volatile`?

* `volatile` is a **field modifier** in Java.
* It tells the JVM and CPU:
  👉 *“This variable is stored in **main memory**, not just CPU caches. Always read the latest value, and always write changes back immediately.”*

In short:

* Guarantees **visibility** (all threads see the most recent value).
* Does **not guarantee atomicity** (except for `long` and `double`, where it ensures atomic reads/writes).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🔹 Problem Without Volatile

By default, each thread may keep a **cached copy** of a variable in a CPU register or local cache.

* Thread A changes a variable.
* Thread B may not see it immediately, because it’s still looking at its cached copy.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🔹 Example Without Volatile

class SharedResource {
    boolean running = true;

    public void runTask() {
        while (running) { // may never exit if cached
            // do some work
        }
        System.out.println("Stopped");
    }
}

public class VolatileDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(resource::runTask);
        t1.start();

        Thread.sleep(1000);

        resource.running = false; // signal thread to stop
        System.out.println("Main updated running=false");
    }
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ⚠️ Problem

* Thread `t1` may **never stop** because it might keep seeing the cached `running = true`.
* The write by the main thread isn’t guaranteed visible to the worker thread.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🔹 Example With Volatile

```java
class SharedResource {
    volatile boolean running = true; // volatile added

    public void runTask() {
        while (running) {
            // do some work
        }
        System.out.println("Stopped");
    }
}
```

### ✅ Behavior

* As soon as `main` sets `running = false`, thread `t1` will **see the change** and exit the loop.
# 🔹 Guarantees of Volatile

1. **Visibility**:

   * All threads immediately see changes to a volatile variable.
   * Reads always fetch the latest value from main memory.

2. **Atomicity for reads/writes of primitives**:

   * For `int`, `boolean`, etc. → reads/writes are already atomic.
   * For `long` and `double` (64-bit types) → volatile ensures atomicity too.

---

# 🔹 Limitations of Volatile

* ❌ **Not atomic for compound actions** (like `count++`).

  volatile int count = 0;
  // Not atomic: read + increment + write
  count++;

  Multiple threads can still cause race conditions. Use `AtomicInteger` or `synchronized` for such cases.
* ❌ Doesn’t replace locks if you need **mutual exclusion**.

---

# 🔹 Real-World Analogy

Think of `volatile` as a **whiteboard in an office**:

* Everyone reads/writes from the central whiteboard (main memory).
* No one uses sticky notes at their desks (CPU cache).
* Everyone always sees the latest message.

But if multiple people try to erase and write at the same time, chaos still happens (no atomicity).

---

# 🔹 Common Use Cases

* **Flags / signals** between threads:

  volatile boolean shutdown = false;

* **Double-checked locking** in singleton patterns.
* **State variables** that need visibility but not compound atomicity.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ In summary:

* `volatile` = **visibility guarantee**, not **atomicity guarantee**.
* Use it for **simple flags or state sharing**.
* Use **Atomic classes or locks** for atomic updates.
